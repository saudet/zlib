/*
     inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
   used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
   complete and before any actual data is decompressed.

     The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
   of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
   present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

     If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

     inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateBackInit OF((z_streamp strm, int windowBits,
                                        unsigned char FAR *window));

     Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
   calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized
   before the call.  If zalloc and zfree are Z_NULL, then the default library-
   derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
   logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
   supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
   assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.

     inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
   the parameters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not be
   allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not match
   the version of the header file.
